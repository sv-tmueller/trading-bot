# New-project setup

Run once when starting a new repo from this template. Create the repo from the
GitHub template (or copy the whole tree, including `.claude/`) and fill in the
`CLAUDE.md` placeholders as you go.

## 1. Repository and protection

- [ ] Create the repo (`gh repo create <name> --template sv-tmueller/claude-template`).
- [ ] Protect `main`: block direct pushes, require a PR, require status checks to
      pass before merge.
- [ ] Create the labels the workflow uses: the sizing set `size:S`, `size:M`,
      `size:L`, `size:XL` (see CLAUDE.md "Sizing") plus `in-progress` and
      `needs-human` (see CLAUDE.md "Agent team").
- [ ] (Optional) Create the labels you will filter on, e.g. `phase:0`, `phase:1`,
      `type:feat`, `type:fix`.

## 2. Claude Code

- [ ] Open the repo in Claude Code and trust the folder. Accept the superpowers
      plugin prompt that `.claude/settings.json` triggers. If no prompt appears
      (a known gap, claude-code#32606), run
      `/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official`.
- [ ] Check the agent team is loaded: `/agents` should list architect,
      developer, tester, and reviewer.
- [ ] Stamp the template version, so `/tm-sync-template` can apply future
      template updates incrementally:
      ```
      gh api repos/sv-tmueller/claude-template/commits/main --jq .sha > .claude/template-version
      ```
      Commit the file.

## 3. Docs structure

- [ ] Create the docs tree:
  ```
  docs/architecture/
  docs/operations/
  docs/plans/
  docs/superpowers/specs/
  ```
- [ ] Add the first architecture note under `docs/architecture/` (stack and policy
      choices).

## 4. Tests and CI/CD

- [ ] Decide the e2e approach for this app and scaffold `e2e/`.
- [ ] Add a CI workflow that runs typecheck, lint, unit tests, build, and e2e.
- [ ] Make the relevant CI jobs required status checks on `main`.
- [ ] If you deploy, make e2e a pre-deploy gate.

## 5. CLAUDE.md

- [ ] Fill "What this repo is" (what, who, status).
- [ ] Fill "Useful commands" with the real install/dev/test/lint/e2e commands.
- [ ] Tailor "Code style" and "What not to do" to this project; delete the rest.
- [ ] Confirm "Workflow defaults" still match how you want to work here.

## 6. First slice of work

- [ ] Brainstorm the first design via `superpowers:brainstorming`; save the spec to
      `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.
- [ ] File the first issues (`gh issue create`), sized, with `Blocked by: #N`
      lines for dependencies.
- [ ] For a single issue: post a short sub-plan on the issue, branch, open a
      draft PR (`Closes #N`), then expand it to a full plan in `docs/plans/`.
- [ ] For a batch of refined issues: run `/tm-kickoff` (see CLAUDE.md "Agent team").
