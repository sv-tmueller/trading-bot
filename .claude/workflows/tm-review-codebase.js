// never leaks into the scout or the workers.

- scope: speculative abstraction, dead configurability, code that could be much smaller.
- tests: behavior with no test pinning it, logic with a right answer lacking a test, integration points with no fixture coverage.
- style: project code and writing style (em dashes, AI-cliche phrases, hard-coded user-facing strings, raw primitives where dedicated types exist, comments that restate code).`
